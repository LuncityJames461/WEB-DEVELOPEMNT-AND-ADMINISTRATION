    <h1>Formatting text</h1>
    <h2>Paragraphs and line breaks</h2>
   <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way
that a page is displayed.<BR> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking
up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation.</p> 
<p>Formatting text to appear
on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear</p> <br><p>in a printed document.</p>
This

is
<p>Cool.</p>
